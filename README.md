  <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
  Fitness and health has always been something that interested me. This interest started when I was a young kid playing all kinds of sports and has continued to grow since. Eventually, I got the opportunity to play college basketball, where physical health became the most important it had ever been in my lifetime. In order to compete at a high level, you need to have strength, stamina, and need to understand how to treat your body. My mission with Kocak Perforamnce Academy is to help athletes of all ages to reach their full potential as an athlete and a person, through hard work in strenth training, stamia building execises, and muscle recovery.
